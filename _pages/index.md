# Welcome! ğŸŒ±

This site is a collection of my thoughts.
I have put them out here unpolished and under construction as a way to circumvent perfectionism and the more general fear that comes with putting yourself out there.  

I hope something in the garden will peak your interest. 
Below are pages that I link to often in my other ideas. I suggest using them as a jumping off point by picking a topic that interests you. Then, simply follow links that interest you. 

- [[ğŸŒ³Conversation]]
- [[ğŸŒ³Creativity]]
- [[ğŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]]
- [[ğŸŒ³Productivity]]
