# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

This site is a collection of my thoughts that I am in the midst of deveopling. I have put them out here unpolished and imperfect. Nonetheless, I hope something in the garden will peak your interest. 

Below are pages that I link to often in my other ideas.  I suggest using them as a jumping off point by picking a topic that interests you and viewing the right sidebar for ideas that have referenced these topics. 

- [[Dungeons and Dragons]]
- [[Conversation]]
- [[_notes/Sean's Garden/01 Original Ideas/Game Design]]
