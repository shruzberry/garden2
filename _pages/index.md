# Welcome! ğŸŒ±

This site is a collection of my thoughts.
I have put them out here unpolished and under construction as a way to circumvent perfectionism and the more general fear that comes with putting yourself out there.  

I hope something in the garden will peak your interest. 
Below are pages that I link to often in my other ideas. I suggest using them as a jumping off point by picking a topic that interests you. Then, simply follow links that interest you.

- [[ğŸŒ³Creativity]]
- [[ğŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]]
- [[ğŸŒ³Productivity]]

## Emojis 

During a notes lifetime, it may undergo changes in status represented by garden themed emojis.

ğŸŒ±
An idea with this symbol means it has been revisited at least once and developed in some way beyond its original postage. That is to say this idea has taken root in the garden and has proven to be something more than a musing.

ğŸŒ³
An idea with this symbol means that a meta trend has developed in my thinking. A note will be promoted to this status when a large number of other ideas point to it. These notes are very similar to categories in the traditional sense 

ğŸŒ¿
When certain ideas grow to an even larger size and have an overwhelming list of ideas pointing to them, this may be an indicator that the category should be subdivided and thus a new note is generated to hold a portion of the links
