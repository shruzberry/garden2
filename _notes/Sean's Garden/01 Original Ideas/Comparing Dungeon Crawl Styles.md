taking into consideration my work from [[Favor Fun over Realism]], and [[The Only Dungeon Map You'll Ever Need]], I would like to create a standard that I will use for more complicated dungeons going forward. The existing styles are as follows

Assumptions
1. A party who wishes to can complete the dungeon in a 3-4 hour session
2. The largest room in a dungeon is 60' x 60' or less

Styles
1. Generate everything
	1. Roll 20
	2. Cut up paper
	3. Fuck ton of tiles
2. Generated rooms but not hallways
	1. Roll 20
	2. Rectangular paper snippets
	3. Almost a fuck ton of tiles
	4. Quick swap tiles
3. Generate 3-5 main rooms where combat is expected to happen
	1. Roll 20
	2. Sheets of paper
	3. A lot of tiles
	4. Swap tiles during initiative
4. Theater of the mind
	1. Just do it forehead

Favorites
1. Generate 3-5 main rooms >> Swap tiles during initiative
2. Generated rooms but not hallways >> Almost a fuck ton of tiles
3. Generate everything >> Roll 20
4. Theater of the mind

Easiest for DM
1. Theater of the mind
2. Generate 3-5 main rooms >> Swap tiles during initiative
3. Generated rooms but not hallways >> Almost a fuck ton of tiles
4. Generate everything >> Roll 20

Makes quality game for players
1. Generated rooms but not hallways >> Almost a fuck ton of tiles
2. Generate everything >> Roll 20
3. Generate 3-5 main rooms >> Swap tiles during initiative
4. Theater of the mind

Scores
1.(6) Generate 3-5 main rooms >> Swap tiles during initiative
2.(6) Generated rooms but not hallways >> Almost a fuck ton of tiles
3.(9) Generate everything >> Roll 20
4.(9) Theater of the mind

Conclusion
Its a tentative tie as depending on player preference two different options could win. For the average case here is the order of winners
1. Use tiles to generate maps on the fly while players or determining initiative
	1. Allows for last minute changes at the expense of time
	2. Only shows players terrain during combat
	3. Compatible with [[Return of the lazy DM]]
	4. Makes players aware of improvization which gives them second hand nervousness
2. Before the session, dragonlock all rooms together while ignoring hallways. Place and remove them from the table as the party's sope changes
	1. Requires more peices 
	2. Visually represents the entire dungeon
	3. element of suprise as explroation and combat pillars look the same
	4. Vulnerable to [[DM Attachment]]

What to solve next
Making solution 1 better
1. Increase player's ability to visualize the dungeon when not in combat >> 
	[[Describing Envronments]]
	Players make maps
2. Decrease construction time 
	[[Step By Step Guide 3D Map Building]]
3. Increase the quality of the quickly generated map
	[[Inspiring Yourself to Make Good Maps]]
4. Act confident to avoid second hand negative emotion

or making solution 2 better
1. reduce the amount of DM attachment
	a. have many small/uninmport rooms that are fine to skip
	b. deal with it
2.
