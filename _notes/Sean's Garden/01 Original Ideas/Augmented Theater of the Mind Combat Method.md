[[Dungeons and Dragons]]

see more adstract note of: [[Augmented Theater of the Mind]] 

This mode of d&d combat revovles around the use of some props and maps items to help enhance the already robust system of [[Theater of the Mind]]. 

As in [[Theater of the Mind]], players may [[Player Co-Creation|inject their own ideas]] into the story with the DMs permission. For example, Players may also [[Player Co-Creation|add things to the encounter]] that they beleive should be there such as a tree to hide behind 

The map on the table only servers as a way to track the encounter not as a way to give players information about what is in from of them. Information presented to the players should be delivered in the form of DM's [[Describing Envronments|descriptions]]
