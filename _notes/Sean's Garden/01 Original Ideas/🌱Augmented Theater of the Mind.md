This mode of gameplay revolves around the use of some props and maps items to help enhance the already robust system of [[ðŸŒ±Theater of the Mind]]. 

As in [[ðŸŒ±Theater of the Mind]], players may inject their own ideas via [[Player Co-Creation]] into the story with the DMs permission. For example, players may add things to the scene that they think should be there. The only restriction is that it must remain in the spirit of the game master's story

The map on the table only servers as a way to track the story and not as a way to give players information about what is in from of them. Information presented to the players should be delivered in an informative yet interpreted form with a good mix of stereotypical details alongside unique ones. Stereotypes are the foundation for [[Player Co-Creation]] as they are easier to work with as a base while unique elements are the foundation for fun and novelty and primarily presented by the DM.
