[[🌳Dungeons and Dragons]]

This mode of gameplay revolves around the use of some props and maps items to help enhance the already robust system of [[🌱Theater of the Mind]]. 

As in [[🌱Theater of the Mind]], players may [[🌰Player Co-Creation|inject their own ideas]] into the story with the DMs permission. For example, Players may also [[🌰Player Co-Creation|add things to the scene]] that they believe should be there so long as it remains in the spirit of the game master's story

The map on the table only servers as a way to track the story and not as a way to give players information about what is in from of them. Information presented to the players should be delivered in an informative yet interpreted form with a good mix of stereotypical details alongside unique ones as stereotypes are the foundation for [[🌰Player Co-Creation]] and unique elements are the foundation for fun and novelty.
