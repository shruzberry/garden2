What dungeons & dragons and other similar games allow for us to do is still tell stories from our own point of view. You done and dragons it is hard to tell a story that is objectively good in the traditional sense. What I mean by this is if you were seeking a story of the highest quality you would watch a movie read a book etc. Dungeons & dragons does not aim to do this but rather it offers people The ability to tell their own stories which helps them develop their own personalities and process emotions
