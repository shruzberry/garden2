There exists an ideal way to create a map for a session that combines the idea of a soft and hard building style. 

Soft map building is defined as a map building style that relies on mind maps of locations and possible connections to other locations. It is used best for theater of theind strategies

Hard map building is defined as a style in which the hard dimensions and things in the map are pre drawn. This is best suited for printed and play or virtual tabletop

Firm map building involves rough sketches of details in a map not necessarily to scale. Advantages are as follows 
- Makes map generation accessible and fast for all
- Allows for last minute swaps
- Compatible with tiles

An alternative way of defining firm maps is that it's a hard map that is not generated until it is being used for play using drawing or placed tiles.
