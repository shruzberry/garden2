[[Thinking]] 

Some system that allows information to be added to an abstract container for later retrieval. Later, as the information becomes relevant, it is pulled out for the user in order to prompt more idea generation to feed back into the system

From a user perspective, this system may feel like a social media platform in the sense that one may scroll until they are inspired from their past idea and then "post" a new idea to inspire their future self
