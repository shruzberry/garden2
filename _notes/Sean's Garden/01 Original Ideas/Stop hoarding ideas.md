I feel like optimizing your second brain systems is a lot like keeping a house clean yet ready to create. As miscast suggested in one of his videos about how not to hoard too many artistic materials he suggested that you go through everything that you have and if you don't have a plan for that material in the near future then throw it away if it inspires you to create a project then you can keep it I think the same idea can be applied to ideas in general if the idea can't be put into a box related to something that you need currently it may not be necessary whoever this becomes easier with Notes that can be stored digitally however you shouldn't try and organize ideas into folders that might be used instead you should put them into folders of things that you're actively trying to collect
