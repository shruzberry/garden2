[[ðŸŒ³Conversation]]

Having a [[ðŸŒ°Digital Garden]] is like cleaning your house before guests come over You're not putting on a mask or pretending to be someone that you aren't You're just spiffing up you as you are and inviting others to experience you. At the current moment, I see nothing wrong with a balanced amount of this so long as the presenter is making an effort to open up their true self.
