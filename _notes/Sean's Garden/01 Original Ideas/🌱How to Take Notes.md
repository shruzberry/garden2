When note taking, do whatever feels natural. Feel free to break structure, waste paper, or write messy

- Reasons for Taking Notes
	- Peace of Mind
	- Capture Curiosity 
	- Improve your work
	- Build 
- Keep Old Notes
	- Keeping old notes allows you to apply new idea in the context of old ideas.
	- Frequently going back to old notes in reference also allows you to learn them via repetition and not have to rely on them as much
- Let old notes decay
	- Rather than fixing old notes as new information arrives, simply try again from the beginning with your new found knowledge. It will help maintain cohesion and avoid frustration as maintaining old documents is difficult. Remember you goal is not to have pretty notes, it's to have at least one note you use.
	- However, don't delete them either, simply dereference them. This will make it easier to part with them. 
- Title Notes Well
	- When titling a note, give a title that would adequately describe what is to be said in the note when read from a random context
	- Similar to assigning good variable names while coding
	- avoid using strange numbering seems as this overcomplicates things
	- If possible, make titles short while being descriptive, this increases in chances of the note being linked to.
	- Avoid acronyms
	- Use the simple and singular noun form when possible
		- exception would be a category such as Areas
		- Use a title that best references it if it were using I a sentence
		- If context is needed, place it in parentheses after the title E.g. [[Items (RPG)]]
