What [[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]] and other similar games allow for us to do is still tell stories from our own point of view. In D&d it is hard to tell a story that is objectively good in the traditional sense: and by this I mean in the way that a movie or book is enjoyable or meaningful to watch or read. What we should do instead is to strive to tell authentic stories instead.

Dungeons & dragons does not aim to do this but rather it offers people The ability to tell their own stories which helps them develop their own personalities and process emotions in a deep way. 

This is to say, It is more along the lines of a deep [[ðŸŒ³Conversation]] than a form of media
