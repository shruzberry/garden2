In the context of an at home rpg, when a player experiments with things in their subconcious at the table in order to gain a better understanding of them
e.g. a traditionally nonconfrontational irl player playing a to the point paladin that takes no BS

This can be concious on the players end or an uncouncious desire becoming manifest
