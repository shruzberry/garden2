There are three common types of [[ðŸŒ¿Dungeons and Dragons Combat]] that I use. Each of which highlights different ways to play the game

## 1) Quick Combat 
The emphasis here is on "Quick". Usually these encounters are resolved within a round or two and do not require much complexity. [[ðŸŒ±Theater of the Mind]] will suffice here 90% of the time. DMG variants such as time factor can be fun here as this is more of a complexified skill check where reaction time matters.

## 2) Augmented Theater of the Mind
In this mode, we use [[ðŸŒ±Theater of the Mind]] in conjunction with other physical elements on the table to achieve a higher level of [[ðŸŒ±Immersion via Aesthetics]]. Situationally, players may also utilize [[Player Co-Creation]] to inject things into the scene that would reasonably be there such as a tree to hide behind. What we mean here is that the player are not restricted to only what is on the table

It's similar in some ways to how players of [[Acting Improv]] use some physical objects such as chairs to aid there play but primarily utilize gestures and body language to paint a picture in the mind.

## 3) Climactic Battles
This is where we Pre-Prepared maps and rely on concrete grids as a guide to our battle in which the stakes matter. It should be something we all expect to happen and are excited to work for.
