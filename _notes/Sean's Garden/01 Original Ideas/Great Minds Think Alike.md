As a kid It would upset me when I had an idea that has already been been though of. I would devote all my energy into having original ideas of some significant value so as to be looked upon as a [[ðŸŒ³Creativity|creative]] individual. I have realized that these ideas come very seldom and with much pain. Having an idea that someone else has had, especially when having no prior knowledge of it, means you understand something that the original inventor did at their movement of discovery. With this deep understanding, you can begin to pick apart the truth and give it a new spin.
