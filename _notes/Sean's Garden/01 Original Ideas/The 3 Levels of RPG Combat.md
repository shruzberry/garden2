## 1) Quick Combat 
The emphasis here is on "Quick". Usually these encounters are resoved within a round or two and do not require much complexity. [[Theater of the Mind]] will suffice here 90% of the time

## 2) Augmented Theater of the Mind
[[Augmented Theater of the Mind Combat Method]] focuses on using props to aid [[Theater of the Mind]] but things are much more interperative and squishy. Players may also [[Player Co-Creation|add things to the encounter]] that they beleive should be there such as a tree to hide behind 

It's similar in some ways to how players of acting improv use some physical objects such as chairs to aid there play but primarily utilize gestures and body language to paint a picture in the mind.

## 3) Climactic Battles
This is where we Pre-Prepared maps and rely on concrete grids as a guide to our battle in which the stakes matter. It should be something we all expect to happen and are excited to work for.
