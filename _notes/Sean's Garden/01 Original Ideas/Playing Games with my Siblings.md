When I used to [[ðŸŒ±Play]] games with my siblings in childhood, there were moments of action and adventure intermixed with slower and more immersive imaginative experiences. When things were slow, quite and personal, I felt immersed in the game. Only then did my role in that game gain more clarity. In a way, it was similar to real life [[Meditation]]

This idea has inspired a technique I use now while playing [[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]] which I like to call [[ðŸŒ±Dropping Into Character]]
