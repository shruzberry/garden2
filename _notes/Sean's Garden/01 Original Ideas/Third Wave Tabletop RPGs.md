Third wave rpg's are a revisit to some of the old ways of doing things mixed with the new ways we have seen in systems such as 5e. I will briefly discuss the first two waves before jumping into this new idea

## Wave 1
Wave 1 is the initial birth of the dungeons and dragons genere of tabletop rpgs. It had a heavy emphasis on gameplay, exploration, puzzles, difficulty, and randomness. It was the precursor to the modern day video game and was consequently much less about story and more about action.

## Wave 2
This is the modern wave of rpgs seen mostly in the 2000s in which more easy to pick up systems such as 5e, dungeon world, etc. came out. It put the game in the hands of not only nerdy/left brainy gamers but rather everyone such that artists, writters, etc joined the game. This gave it a turn towards story rather than gameplay. The interenet aided this boom with shows like critical role which were highly consumable to an audience craving an epic long and detailed story.

## Wave 3 (theorized)
Although not yet fully actualized, third wave d&d promises to combine the fun of the old systems with the meaningfullness of the new systems. There are a few key elements of this way of playing that I will list as seperate notes
