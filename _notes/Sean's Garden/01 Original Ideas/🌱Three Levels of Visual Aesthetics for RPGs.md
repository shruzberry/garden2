[[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]] [[ðŸŒ±Immersion via Aesthetics]]

**Level 0: Imagination**

**Level 1: Space**
In level one, the most important thing is to give each significant element of the scene a physical representation on the board. However, it is permitted to use anything to achieve this goal such that it is of appropriete size. For example, a salt shaker may be a pillar, a chess peice a character and so on. The goal of this level is to accuratly space out elements in the room to allow line of sight blockers, interesting movement, and relativity of size such as a goblin fighting a much larger ogre.
requirements:
	1. An item is used for each significant gameplay element
	2. Items are of appropriete size

**Level 2: Shape**
In this level, we begin to add shape to the pieces mentioned before. The pieces act as Iconic representations of items in the scene. However they can still be interpereted to be many unique things based on their context. E.g. a wall can be flipped on its side to be a bridge or a door may be used as a table. The major differences this level has over level 1 is that...
	1. The pieces are designed for the use of terrain (not just common household objects). The reason for this is that the aformentioned salt shaker representing a pillar will most likely remind players of a salt shaker first and a pillar secondarily
	2. An effort is made to use items that are of appropriete shape
	3. Shapes are useful: possibly in a variety of ways

**Level 3: Color**
In this stage, color is added to the pieces to tell further story that shape alone cannot tell. In the color stage, we start to branch away from utility and more into beauty, aesthetics, and emotion. We may not know why a piece looks better, sadder, holier, or more dangerous when we apply different colors to it, but we do know that it delivers on an emotion. Because of this it becomes difficult in this stage to find the balance of effort and output. It may help to list out emotional and aesthetical goals you have for a piece and work to check them off while adding color and withold going past it.
requirements:
	1. Colors are appropriete to the setting

**Level 4: Realism**
Now, we reach the level of full realism in the terrain we use. These pieces can be heavily scrutinized without breaking immersion and any artistic quality they contain transfers directly into the game world.

**Fuzzy Realism Threshhold**
The point at which someone who needs glasses to drive but does not currently have them on could not see a difference in detail.
