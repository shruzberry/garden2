In [[ðŸŒ°Worldbuilding]], limiting the aesthetic scope of your game can allow for more fine detail in creation. For example, in [[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]], utilizing Planes of existence allow for focused monster types, terrain, and other gameplay elements which make [[ðŸŒ±Immersion via Aesthetics]] much more straight forward. 

This same concept is what I enjoy about the [[ðŸŒ°Myst]] universe. In this game, various pocket dimensions are created with limited space and aesthetic variation. Doing this is a more natural way for a game master to predict what the players may run into as they can only travel so far. 

Another more classic example of this could be the mysterious fog surrounding Barovia in "Curse of Strahd"
