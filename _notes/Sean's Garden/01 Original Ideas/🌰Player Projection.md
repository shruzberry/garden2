In the context of [[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons]] or other rpgs, player projection is when a player experiments with things in their [[ðŸŒ±Subconscious]] at the table in order to gain a better understanding of them
e.g. a traditionally nonconfrontational irl player playing a to the point paladin that takes no BS

This can be conscious on the players end or an unconscious desire becoming manifest
