There exists a problem especially as it pertains to purchasing things for creative endeavors and other productive things that is at times we are more impulsive and that other times we are more passive all of which affects our willingness to purchase necessary things that are needed for creative projects.

The question is how do we balance those two extremes so that we're making better decisions

1. Have a partner who can help determine the worth of a purchase so that between at least two opinions there is a more averaged emotional state
2. Give yourself a minimum time frame before you make the purchase such as 24 hours. This is similar to the first tip however it uses you in a separate emotional state as the second person.
3. By the same logic for the first two tips combine them to create opportunities for more samples of emotional state. For example you may, alongside your partner, more frequently ask yourself the question in a 24-hour period to get say six samples

The strategy is very good at defending against impulsivity however it doesn't directly address defending against passivity. In this case I would encourage aligning your projects more with what directly interests you such that you induce a more positive mindset on what you're doing. In other words try and get yourself excited to do something and buy things and then dial back from there
