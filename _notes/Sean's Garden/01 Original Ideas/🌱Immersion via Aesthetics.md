# Immersion via Aesthetics
Inspired by [Sebastian Lang from Atmoseeker](https://www.youtube.com/c/Atmoseeker) I have begun an effort to make my [[ðŸŒ³Dungeons and Dragons|D&d Games]] much more engaging by use of highly Aesthetic set peices which serve to enhance the overal mood and tone of the game.

## How much aesthetics do you need?
I like to think of my approach to visual aesthetics to d&d in [[ðŸŒ±Three Levels of Visual Aesthetics for RPGs|3 levels]]. The main purpose of this is to allow for flexibility. Building your aesthtics to the standards of a lower level has the benefits of being very quick, something which is very valuable to a creator. Building to a higher level, on the other hand allows for more precise detail which hightens existing aesthetic immersion. 
Build to whatever level you wish for each element with more important aspects being given more attention. For example, basic NPCs may only need an image ripped from the web while a final boss may warrent a fully painted miniature. Keep in mind though that too much detail may be distracting to players in addition to being time consuming. They may fixate on the cool paint jobs, fancy terrain, and nifty handouts rather than on what you wish for them to focus on. 

This brings me to...

## Diversify Your Efforts
If you have 1 hour to prep for a session, it is far better to split your time amoungst several different things that may provide value to the experience rather than focusing on 1 or 2 aspects. There are two main reasons for this
1. Law of diminishing returns
2. [[ðŸŒ°DM Attachment]]
