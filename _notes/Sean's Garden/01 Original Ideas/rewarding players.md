Each player finds different things to be rewarding but some common things are
- [[Items (RPG)]] to enable gameplay
- information that makes the player feel like they are progressing
- a new quest

 Tying these things together is the idea that being able to play the game player wishes to play it is the best reward for playing. Or in other words, the opportunity to [[Play]] is the best reward

 Use rewards to get players to do what they want
