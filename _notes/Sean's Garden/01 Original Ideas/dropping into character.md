When the DM instucts the players to "drop into character", all players instantly imerse themselves into the character they are playing for a brief period of time in an attempt to better personify and [[Role Play]] that character. 

This process is considered an rpg sub mode

When players do this, they each visualize personally the story they are all a part of based on the knowledge, intuitions, and emotions they currently hold.

[[story conflicts]] that develop with this method can simply be ignored assuming the context that this method is used is not somethings critical to the story. ideally, this method is only used in response to significant events and not to decide them

This idea appears to conflict with the [[basic game loop of d&d]] as the DM cannot narrate the outcome of player decisions. This is another reason why we treat this as a tangential mode of [[Play]] that refrains from deciding storoy elements and exists souly to develop the [[player characters]]

Although it is not strictly required, it may be enjoyable for players to, at a later time, discuss what each of them envisioned in their character drops in order to see if the groups collective perceptions of each character aligns to some degree. 

`player 1: I saw Owen wander off and not say a word to anyone else`
`player 2: Yeah Owen was being very wierd and I wished he would talk to us about what was going on with him`
