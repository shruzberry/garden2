[[ðŸŒ¿D&d Combat]]

Here are some tips for making combat run faster
1. Players should have their turn conceptualized when their turn starts and only spend their time describing action and rolling
	- Questions can be asked to other players quietly
	- Information should be looked up independently
2. The DM should engineer the encounter to reduce the number of monster turns to roughly the number of player turns and disperse them through the initiative using a method such as [[ðŸŒ°Initiative by Point Buy]]
3. The game state should be visually clear at all times to minimize the number of questions need to ask the DM
4. Avoid reading rule blocks and instead have the player describe the direct effect the rule has on the current game state
