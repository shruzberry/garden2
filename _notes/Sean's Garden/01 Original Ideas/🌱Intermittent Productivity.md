[[ðŸŒ³Productivity]]
This is the concept of being able to maintain productivity in a context in which you only have short and unpredictable windows in which you can productively work such as while at work, taking care of kids, etc.

Getting interrupted while working can lead to a lot of frustration and ultimately to the the avoidance of [[ðŸŒ±Work]] all together when in these environments.

## Smaller Units of Work
Condense your work into very small units for [[ðŸŒ°Microtasking]] in order to reduce the chance of being interrupted
Break up tasks you think need to happen all at once into smaller units

## Prepare, then Execute
If your mind is still at least free, think of what you will do and do it at the next available moment
